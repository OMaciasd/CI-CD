# Pipeline: Update Gitsubmodules for two or more projects as GitLab repositories!

- Date: 22/03/2023.


### Description.

- Hi, Built a pipeline for the DevOps phase, within the software lifecycle with Continuous Integration. Which can update any change in one or more repositories from their respective submodules in the GitLab PaaS.


## Requirements.

- Have a GitLab Account.
- Have a Server for the private runner (EC2, WSL, Docker, Ubuntu, VM)
- Create or clone Two or more projects with repositories and submodules.

## Walkthrought.

- Clone or build all repositories on the platform, or on your local PC in the development environment.
- Synchronize each repository with its respective submodules.
- Build the yml file for each repository.
- Install the GitLab CE service, such as the Runner package.
- Register a shell for the Runner of the DevOps phases of the CI/CD lifecycle.
- Upload new changes.
- Evaluate the lifecycle of each pipeline in the workflow as a trigger, just like the Runner.
